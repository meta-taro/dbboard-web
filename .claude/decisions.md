# Technical decisions

Append-only log of significant technical decisions. Each entry: date, decision, context, alternatives considered, rationale.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Frontend framework: Nuxt

**Context.** A browser-based counterpart to the `dbboard` desktop client is needed.

**Alternatives.** Next.js, SvelteKit, Remix.

**Decision.** Nuxt (Vue 3, TypeScript).

**Rationale.** Vue's reactivity model fits the live-query / live-result use case well, Nuxt provides a mature SSR + Nitro server story, and the ecosystem covers auto-imports, route handlers, and server middleware out of the box.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Backend framework: NestJS

**Context.** An API layer separating the frontend from databases.

**Alternatives.** Fastify (vanilla), Hono, Express, embedding the API into Nuxt's Nitro server.

**Decision.** NestJS.

**Rationale.** Module boundaries map cleanly to the layered architecture rule. Built-in dependency injection makes the AI provider plug-in pattern straightforward.

## 2026-05-19 — Package manager: pnpm

**Context.** Supply-chain and dependency-correctness concerns make `npm` undesirable for this project.

**Decision.** pnpm only; `npm` and `yarn` are forbidden.

**Rationale.** Strict dependency resolution avoids phantom imports, `onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlists install scripts, `minimumReleaseAge` quarantines freshly published versions, and the `packageManager` field plus `corepack` give reproducible installs.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Language for repository artifacts: English

**Context.** Open-source project intended for an external audience.

**Decision.** All files in the repository (markdown, code comments, commit messages, PR text) are written in English. Direct maintainer↔assistant dialogue may remain in Japanese.

**Rationale.** Maximizes contributor reach without making maintenance harder for the primary maintainer, who prefers Japanese for personal channels.

## 2026-05-19 — Relationship with `dbboard` desktop client

**Context.** `dbboard-web` and the desktop client `dbboard` (https://github.com/meta-taro/dbboard) are developed by the same maintainer. The desktop client is a **native Rust GUI** application with its own **local Rust API layer**. The two clients do **not** communicate with each other at runtime — they are independent applications that happen to expose the same conceptual API surface to their own UI layer.

**Decision.**

- The two repositories are **fully independent applications**, not two faces of one product:
  - `dbboard-web`: Nuxt UI + NestJS API + databases (this repo).
  - `dbboard`: native Rust GUI + local Rust API + databases.
- **No runtime coupling.** Neither client calls the other's API; neither shares process, build, or release pipelines. A user can install either or both without dependencies between them.
- **What is shared:** the **API contract** only — connection definition shape, query request and response envelopes, error category codes, schema metadata shape, and AI provider request and response shapes. The contract is described in human-readable form so each repository can translate it into idiomatic types for its language (TypeScript DTOs here, `serde` structs there).
- **What is NOT shared:** controllers, services, DB drivers, UI components, build tooling, dependency lockfiles, or any source code.
- **User-data interop.** Export and import formats for connections and query history use the same JSON shape on both sides, so a user can move state between desktop and web. This is the only artifact the two clients exchange.
- **Pace policy.** Maintainer attention is split between the two repos. Phases on each side are sized to be completable in a single focused session, and changes never leave either repo in a broken state. Either side may move ahead on any phase without waiting for the other.
- **Contract evolution.** When the shared API surface changes, the side that needs the change updates the contract first (in human-readable docs), then both sides adopt it on their own schedule. Implementation duplication is permanent and acceptable — the two stacks are too different to share code.

**Rationale.** A native Rust GUI cannot meaningfully reuse a NestJS server or TypeScript UI components, so attempting to share implementation would be pure cost. Keeping the contract aligned by convention captures the only real coupling (consistent vocabulary and exportable user data) without forcing either codebase to compromise on language idioms or tooling.

**Cross-references.** This decision is mirrored on the desktop side as `dbboard/docs/decisions.md` ADR-0004 (revised) and ADR-0006 (local axum HTTP backend, loopback, auto-port).

## 2026-05-19 — Initial sequencing: `dbboard` Phase 1 runs before `dbboard-web` Phase 1

**Context.** Both repos are at Phase 0. Either side may proceed independently per the coordination policy above, but the maintainer's attention is split. We need an explicit "what to do this week" without rewriting the coordination policy.

**Decision.**

- `dbboard` (desktop) Phase 1 — Turso vertical slice — runs first.
- `dbboard-web` Phase 1 — monorepo scaffold — is staged behind it.
- Once the desktop slice is working end-to-end, the API contract is drafted (canonical form to be decided) and `dbboard-web` Phase 1 starts.

**Rationale.** `dbboard-web` Phase 1 is mostly scaffolding (pnpm workspace, empty Nuxt + NestJS apps). Doing it first would not move the actual problem forward, and any contract assumptions it bakes in would have to be revised once the desktop slice reveals real shapes. Letting the desktop slice ship first means the web scaffold can lock in a contract that already runs somewhere.

**Reversibility.** Cheap to reverse — neither repo has implementation code that depends on the sequence.
